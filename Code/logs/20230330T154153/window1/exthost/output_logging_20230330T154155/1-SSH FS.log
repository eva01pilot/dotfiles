Created output channel for vscode-sshfs
When posting your logs somewhere, keep the following in mind:
  - While the logging tries to censor your passwords/passphrases/..., double check!
    Maybe you also want to censor out e.g. the hostname/IP you're connecting to.
  - If you want to report an issue regarding authentication or something else that
    seems to be more of an issue with the actual SSH2 connection, it might be handy
    to reconnect with this added to your User Settings (settings.json) first:
      "sshfs.flags": [ "DEBUG_SSH2" ],
    This will (for new connections) also enable internal SSH2 logging.
